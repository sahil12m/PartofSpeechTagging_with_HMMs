# Description

This project focuses on hands-on experience with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) applied to part-of-speech tagging. The project utilizes the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank dataset to construct an HMM model for this tagging task. Within the "data" folder, three files—train, dev, and test—are provided. The "train" and "dev" files contain sentences with human-annotated part-of-speech tags, serving as training and development data. In contrast, the "test" file presents raw sentences where the objective is to predict the part-of-speech tags using the HMM model developed during training. This project aims to enhance understanding and application of HMMs in the context of part-of-speech tagging, emphasizing practical implementation on real-world language data.

 The project includes 2 methods to solve the task:
1) Greedy Decoding with HMMs
2) Vitebri Decoding with HMMs
